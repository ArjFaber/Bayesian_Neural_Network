# Bayesian_Neural_Network
## Usage
This is the README file for my study regarding the performance of a single hidden-layer Bayesian Neural Network on a weather forecast dataset.

## Installation
To run this program Python 3.11.7 or higher is required. Furthermore, several libraries are used and required to be installed beforehand. That is, I use TensorFlow 2.15, TensorFlow_probability, silence_TensorFlow, Scikit_Learn and evaluation_metrics for developing the Bayesian Neural Network.  

## Data description
The dataset contains 1461 datapoints containing the current weather (drizzle,fog,rain,snow or sun)  precipitation, maximum-and-minimum temperature and wind. In the Jupyter Notebook a quick data description is included. For this problem we would like to obtain the dependent variable maximum temperature by letting the neural network train the dataset containing the features current weather, precipitation, minimum temperature and wind.
